# Feature Specification: Household Management Mobile Application

**Feature Branch**: `003-household-management-mobile`
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Household Management Mobile Application - Mobile app for residents to manage household members, vehicle stickers, guests, construction permits, deliveries, announcements, and fees"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Request and Track Vehicle Stickers (Priority: P1)

A household head or member needs to request vehicle stickers for their cars, upload required documents, track approval status, and view active stickers with expiry dates to ensure authorized vehicle access to the community.

**Why this priority**: Vehicle access is the most frequent daily interaction residents have with the community system. Without stickers, residents cannot enter the gates with their vehicles, making this the highest priority for user satisfaction and operational necessity.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a sticker request with vehicle details and OR/CR documents, tracking approval status, viewing active stickers, and requesting renewal when expiring. Delivers immediate value by enabling vehicle access without admin intervention for initial request.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a household member logs into the app, **When** they request a new vehicle sticker, select a household member or beneficial user, enter vehicle details (plate, make, model, color, type), and upload OR/CR documents, **Then** the sticker request is submitted and status shows as "requested"
2. **Given** a sticker request has been submitted, **When** the admin approves it, **Then** the user receives a notification and the sticker appears in their active stickers list with expiry date
3. **Given** a sticker is approaching expiry (within 30 days), **When** the user views their stickers, **Then** they see expiry warning and can tap to request renewal
4. **Given** a sticker request is rejected, **When** the user views the request, **Then** they see rejection reason and can resubmit with corrections
5. **Given** a user has multiple active stickers, **When** they view the sticker list, **Then** they see all stickers with vehicle details, assigned person, and expiry dates

---

### User Story 2 - Schedule and Manage Guests (Priority: P1)

A household member schedules guest visits by entering guest details, setting arrival/departure times, and sending the guest list to security so visitors can enter smoothly without delays at the gate.

**Why this priority**: Guest management is a critical daily convenience feature. Without it, residents must call security for every visitor, creating friction and delays. This directly impacts quality of life and security efficiency.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by scheduling a day-trip or multi-day guest with details and vehicle info, receiving QR code/pass, editing or canceling the visit, and getting notified when guest arrives. Delivers immediate value by streamlining visitor access.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a household member wants to schedule a guest, **When** they enter guest details (name, phone, vehicle plate, purpose), set expected arrival/departure times, and submit, **Then** the guest is added to the schedule and security receives the guest list
2. **Given** a guest visit is scheduled, **When** the guest arrives at the gate and security verifies their identity, **Then** the household member receives a notification that their guest has arrived
3. **Given** a guest visit is scheduled for multiple days, **When** the dates span across several days, **Then** the guest pass remains valid for the entire duration
4. **Given** plans change, **When** the household member edits guest details or cancels the visit, **Then** the updated information is immediately sent to security
5. **Given** a guest arrives, **When** the household member views guest status, **Then** they see arrival timestamp and can confirm guest receipt

---

### User Story 3 - View and Pay Association Fees (Priority: P1)

A household head views fee statements, checks payment due dates, pays fees using mobile payment options, and downloads receipts to manage their financial obligations to the HOA.

**Why this priority**: Fee payment is a core financial obligation that must be convenient and accessible. Without mobile payment, residents must visit the office or use manual methods, causing delays and reducing collection efficiency. This is critical for HOA operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing fee statements, checking due dates and amounts, paying via mobile payment gateway, and downloading receipt. Delivers immediate value by enabling convenient payment without office visits.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a household head logs in, **When** they view fee statements, **Then** they see all fees (monthly, quarterly, annual, special assessments) with amounts, due dates, and payment status
2. **Given** an unpaid fee exists, **When** the household head selects it and chooses to pay, **Then** they are directed to payment gateway (Stripe, PayMongo, or GCash) to complete transaction
3. **Given** payment is completed successfully, **When** the transaction confirms, **Then** fee status updates to "paid" and a receipt is generated
4. **Given** a fee is paid, **When** the household head views payment history, **Then** they see all past payments with dates, amounts, and can download receipts
5. **Given** fees are overdue, **When** the household head views statements, **Then** overdue fees are highlighted with late fee calculation if applicable

---

### User Story 4 - Submit and Track Construction Permits (Priority: P2)

A household head submits construction permit requests with project details, contractor information, and plans, pays road fees online, and tracks permit status from submission through completion.

**Why this priority**: Construction permits are important but infrequent compared to daily access needs. While essential for home improvements, most households won't use this feature regularly, making it a secondary priority after core access and payment features.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting permit request with construction details and contractor info, uploading plans, paying road fees via mobile payment, tracking status, and viewing permit history. Delivers value by eliminating office visits for permit submission.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a household head wants to start construction, **When** they submit a permit request with construction type, description, dates, contractor information (name, phone, email, estimated workers), and upload plans/documents, **Then** the request is submitted to admin for review
2. **Given** a permit request is approved by admin, **When** the household head receives approval notification, **Then** they see the calculated road fee and can pay immediately via mobile payment
3. **Given** road fee payment is completed, **When** the transaction confirms, **Then** permit status changes to "paid" and household can proceed with construction
4. **Given** construction begins, **When** the permit status is updated to "in_progress" by admin, **Then** the household head can schedule construction workers' gate passes
5. **Given** construction is ongoing, **When** the household head views permit details, **Then** they see current status, payment confirmation, and can generate worker passes for gate access

---

### User Story 5 - Receive and Manage Delivery Notifications (Priority: P2)

A household member receives notifications when packages arrive at the gate, confirms delivery receipt, marks items as received, and views delivery history to track all incoming packages.

**Why this priority**: Delivery management enhances convenience but isn't critical for basic community access. While valuable for security and package tracking, it's a supplementary feature that can be implemented after core access and payment capabilities.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by receiving delivery notification from security, viewing delivery details, confirming receipt, uploading delivery photo, and viewing history. Delivers value by providing delivery visibility and security.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a package arrives at the community gate, **When** security logs the delivery, **Then** the household member receives a push notification with delivery details
2. **Given** a delivery notification is received, **When** the household member views it, **Then** they see delivery company, tracking number (if available), and arrival timestamp
3. **Given** the household member retrieves the package, **When** they mark the delivery as received and optionally upload a photo, **Then** the delivery status updates and is archived in delivery history
4. **Given** multiple deliveries exist, **When** the household member views delivery history, **Then** they see all past deliveries with dates, statuses, and photos
5. **Given** a delivery is at the gate, **When** the household member hasn't confirmed receipt after 24 hours, **Then** they receive a reminder notification

---

### User Story 6 - Manage Household and Beneficial Users (Priority: P2)

A household head adds, edits, or removes household members and beneficial users, captures their details with photos, designates primary contacts, and manages who has access to household services.

**Why this priority**: Household management is essential for administrative control but doesn't require immediate implementation for basic app functionality. Initial household setup is done by admins, so residents primarily need this for updates and additions, making it secondary to access and payment features.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by adding family members with photos and details, adding beneficial users (e.g., helpers, drivers), editing member information, marking primary contact, and removing members. Delivers value by giving household heads control over their household composition.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a household head logs in, **When** they add a household member with name, relationship, date of birth, contact info, and photo, **Then** the member is added to the household and can be associated with stickers and guest visits
2. **Given** a household head needs to add a non-resident beneficial user (e.g., driver, helper), **When** they add the beneficial user with details, **Then** the user is associated with the household and can be assigned vehicle stickers
3. **Given** household members exist, **When** the household head marks one as the primary household contact, **Then** that member receives priority notifications and communications
4. **Given** a household member's details change, **When** the household head edits their information, **Then** updates are saved and reflected across all household features
5. **Given** a beneficial user is no longer needed, **When** the household head removes them, **Then** their access is revoked and any associated stickers are deactivated

---

### User Story 7 - View Community Announcements (Priority: P3)

A household member views community announcements, filters by type, marks them as read, and receives push notifications for urgent announcements to stay informed about community matters.

**Why this priority**: Announcements provide valuable community information but are not critical for core app functionality. Residents can function without this feature, making it an enhancement that improves engagement but isn't required for basic operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing announcement feed, filtering by type (general, urgent, event, maintenance, fee reminder, election), marking as read, and receiving push notifications for urgent items. Delivers value by keeping residents informed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** community announcements exist, **When** a household member opens the announcements section, **Then** they see all announcements sorted by date with unread indicators
2. **Given** announcements of different types exist, **When** the household member applies a filter, **Then** only announcements of the selected type (general, urgent, event, maintenance, fee_reminder, election) are displayed
3. **Given** an announcement is viewed, **When** the household member reads it, **Then** it is automatically marked as read and unread count decreases
4. **Given** an urgent announcement is published, **When** it becomes available, **Then** the household member receives an immediate push notification
5. **Given** announcements have attachments, **When** the household member views them, **Then** they can download attached documents or view images

---

### User Story 8 - Manage Profile and Settings (Priority: P3)

A household head updates their profile information, changes password, sets notification preferences, and views household details to maintain accurate account information and control app behavior.

**Why this priority**: Profile management is important for personalization but not critical for core functionality. Users can operate the app with default settings, making this a lower priority enhancement that improves user experience but isn't essential for launch.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by updating profile info, changing password, configuring notification preferences (push, email, SMS), enabling biometric authentication, and viewing household information. Delivers value through personalization and security control.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a household head wants to update their information, **When** they edit their profile with new contact details, **Then** changes are saved and reflected across the system
2. **Given** security is important, **When** the household head changes their password, **Then** they must enter current password, new password meets requirements, and change is confirmed
3. **Given** notification preferences need adjustment, **When** the household head configures settings for push, email, or SMS notifications per feature (stickers, guests, fees, announcements), **Then** preferences are saved and future notifications follow these settings
4. **Given** the device supports biometric authentication, **When** the household head enables Face ID or Touch ID, **Then** future logins can use biometric instead of password
5. **Given** the household head wants to view household information, **When** they access household details, **Then** they see residence number, household members, active stickers, and subscription status
