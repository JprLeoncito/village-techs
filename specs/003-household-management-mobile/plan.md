# Implementation Plan: Household Management Mobile Application

**Branch**: `003-household-management-mobile` | **Date**: 2025-10-16 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-household-management-mobile/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

The Household Management Mobile Application is a React Native app for residents to manage household members, vehicle stickers, guests, construction permits, deliveries, announcements, and fees. The app provides core access management (stickers, guests) and payment capabilities (fees, permits) with a mobile-first design.

Key technical approach: Use Supabase directly for all data operations with simple caching via AsyncStorage, eliminating the complexity of WatermelonDB offline-first architecture while maintaining essential offline viewing capabilities.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.3+ (strict mode), React Native 0.81+
**Primary Dependencies**: Expo SDK 54+, Supabase JS client, React Navigation, NativeWind (Tailwind CSS), React Hook Form + Zod, Expo modules (camera, notifications, secure store)
**Storage**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) as primary database with AsyncStorage for simple caching
**Testing**: Jest + React Native Testing Library for unit tests, Detox for E2E tests
**Target Platform**: iOS 13+ and Android 8+ (Expo managed workflow)
**Project Type**: Mobile React Native app with Supabase backend
**Performance Goals**: <2s app load time, <1s cached data access, <3min payment flow, >95% payment success rate
**Constraints**: Must work offline for viewing cached data, handle poor network conditions, secure biometric authentication, multi-tenant data isolation
**Scale/Scope**: Supports 10k+ households, 50+ screens, 25+ features, offline queue for critical actions

## Architecture Clarifications

**Data Architecture Decision**: Use Supabase directly for all data operations with simple caching via AsyncStorage. This eliminates the complexity of WatermelonDB offline-first architecture while maintaining essential offline viewing capabilities as specified in FR-070 to FR-073.

**Rationale**:
- Existing data is already in Supabase from admin dashboard implementations
- Simpler implementation reduces development time and maintenance burden
- AsyncStorage caching provides sufficient offline viewing for stickers, guests, fees, and announcements
- Critical actions (sticker requests, guest scheduling) can be queued for sync when connection returns
- Removes need for complex data synchronization between local SQLite and remote PostgreSQL

**Payment Integration**: Mock payment service for development, with architecture supporting Stripe, PayMongo, and GCash integration via Supabase Edge Functions when ready for production.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*
