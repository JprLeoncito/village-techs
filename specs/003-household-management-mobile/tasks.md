## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup (Phase 1) - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-10)**: All depend on Foundational (Phase 2) completion
  - Recommended sequential order for single developer: US1 (P1) ‚Üí US2 (P1) ‚Üí US3 (P1) ‚Üí US4 (P2) ‚Üí US5 (P2) ‚Üí US6 (P2) ‚Üí US7 (P3) ‚Üí US8 (P3)
  - Parallel execution possible with team: US1, US2, US3 can run simultaneously after Foundational
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - MVP)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ **START HERE**
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies (independent guest scheduling)
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Depends on payment service from Foundational (T027-T031)
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after US3 - Shares payment flow with fees
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies (delivery notifications)
- **User Story 6 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies (household management)
- **User Story 7 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies (announcements)
- **User Story 8 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies (profile/settings)

### Mobile-Specific Dependencies

- **WatermelonDB Setup (T014-T018)**: Required before any offline storage (US1-US8 all depend on this)
- **Payment Integration (T027-T031)**: Required before US3 (fees) and US4 (permits)
- **Push Notifications (T039-T040)**: Required before US1 (sticker approval), US2 (guest arrival), US5 (delivery), US7 (urgent announcements)
- **Camera Integration (T041)**: Required before US1 (OR/CR upload), US5 (delivery photo), US6 (member photo)

### Offline/Online Sync Dependencies

- **Network Status (T023)**: Required for all offline-capable user stories (US1, US2, US4, US5, US6, US8)
- **Sync Queue (T024)**: Required for all queued actions (sticker requests, guest scheduling, permit submission, profile updates)
- **Sync Manager (T018)**: Required for WatermelonDB ‚Üî Supabase bidirectional sync

### Platform Testing Dependencies

- **iOS Tests**: Require iOS Simulator or physical iPhone, Xcode Command Line Tools, Detox iOS setup
- **Android Tests**: Require Android Emulator or physical Android device, Android Studio, Detox Android setup
- **Both Platforms**: All E2E tests (T045-T046, T062-T063, T078-T079, T095-T096, T110-T111, T124-T125, T139-T140, T152-T153) must pass on BOTH iOS and Android

### Within Each User Story

- **Tests BEFORE Implementation**: Unit tests ‚Üí E2E tests (iOS + Android) ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Checkpoint
- Offline/Online components in parallel (different files)
- Shared services before screen-specific logic
- Core implementation before platform-specific polish

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks T001-T013 can run in parallel (marked [P])

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- WatermelonDB models T015 (8 models) can all run in parallel
- Supabase services T019-T022 can run in parallel
- Payment services T027-T031 can run in parallel
- UI components T038 can run in parallel
- Notification service T039-T040 can run in parallel

**Within User Stories**:
- All components marked [P] can run in parallel (different files)
- All unit tests marked [P] can run in parallel
- iOS and Android E2E tests can run in parallel on separate machines
- Example US1: T047, T048, T049, T050 (4 components) + T043, T044 (2 unit tests) can all run in parallel

**Cross-Story Parallelization** (if team capacity):
- After Foundational completes, US1 + US2 + US6 can start simultaneously (3 developers)
- US3 + US4 share payment logic, better sequential or shared developer
- US5 + US7 + US8 are independent, can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Vehicle Stickers)

```bash
# After Foundational (Phase 2) completes, launch US1 in parallel:

# Tests in parallel:
Task: "[iOS/Android] Unit test sticker request validation"
Task: "[iOS/Android] Unit test sticker sync queue"
Task: "[iOS] E2E test sticker request offline ‚Üí online sync"
Task: "[Android] E2E test sticker request offline ‚Üí online sync"

# Components in parallel:
Task: "Create StickerRequestForm component"
Task: "Create StickerList component"
Task: "Create StickerStatusTracker component"
Task: "Create DocumentUploadComponent"

# Then sequential (depend on above):
Task: "Implement sticker request service with offline queue"
Task: "Setup Realtime subscription for approvals"
Task: "Create StickersScreen"
```

**Result**: 4 tests + 4 components built in parallel, then integrated sequentially ‚Üí US1 complete faster

---

## Parallel Example: Multiple User Stories with Platform Testing

```bash
# After Foundational (Phase 2) completes, assign to 4 developers:

Developer 1: Work on User Story 1 (Stickers) - Tasks T043-T059 + iOS/Android tests
Developer 2: Work on User Story 2 (Guests) - Tasks T060-T075 + iOS/Android tests
Developer 3: Work on User Story 3 (Fees + Payments) - Tasks T076-T092 + iOS/Android tests
Developer 4: Setup Offline Sync Monitoring and Payment Services - Tasks T023-T026, T027-T031

# All complete in parallel, then:
Developer 1: Work on User Story 4 (Permits) - Tasks T093-T107
Developer 2: Work on User Story 5 (Deliveries) - Tasks T108-T121
Developer 3: Work on User Story 6 (Household) - Tasks T122-T136
Developer 4: Work on User Story 7 (Announcements) - Tasks T137-T149

# Then all developers work on User Story 8 + Polish
```

**Result**: 8 user stories + platform tests completed in ~5 sprint cycles vs 8+ sequential
