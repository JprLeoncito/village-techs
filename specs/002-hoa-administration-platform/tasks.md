## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup (Phase 1) - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational (Phase 2) completion
  - Recommended sequential order for single developer: US1 (P1) ‚Üí US2 (P1) ‚Üí US3 (P1) ‚Üí US4 (P2) ‚Üí US5 (P2) ‚Üí US6 (P2) ‚Üí US7 (P3)
  - Parallel execution possible with team: US1, US2, US3 can run simultaneously after Foundational
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - MVP)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ **START HERE**
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Requires households from US1 for testing sticker approval
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Requires households from US1 for fee assignment
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Requires households from US1 for permit association
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Requires households from US1 for announcement targeting
- **User Story 6 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Depends on Feature 004 (Security app) for gate_entries/incidents data
- **User Story 7 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - Best with data from US1-US6 for realistic analytics

### RLS Policy Testing Dependencies

- **RLS Tests (T038-T044)**: Depend on database schema creation (T012-T021) and policy creation (T022-T030)
- **Run pgTAP (T044)**: Depends on all RLS test files written (T038-T043)

### Within Each User Story

- **Tests BEFORE Implementation**: Contract tests (API) ‚Üí Integration tests (E2E) ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Checkpoint
- Models/schema before services (Phase 2 foundational)
- Services/hooks before UI components
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks T001-T011 can run in parallel (marked [P])

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- Database tables T013-T021 can run in parallel (different tables)
- RLS policies T022-T030 can run in parallel after tables
- Views and RPCs T031-T037 can run in parallel after tables
- RLS tests T038-T043 can all run in parallel (different test files)
- Frontend foundation T045-T052 can all run in parallel

**Within User Stories**:
- All components marked [P] can run in parallel (different files)
- All contract tests marked [P] can run in parallel (different test files)
- Example US1: T054, T055, T056 (3 contract tests) can run in parallel
- Example US1: T058, T059, T060, T061 (4 components) can run in parallel

**Cross-Story Parallelization** (if team capacity):
- After Foundational completes, US1 + US2 + US3 can start simultaneously (3 developers)
- US4 + US5 can start in parallel after US1 completes (for household test data)
- US6 depends on Feature 004 gate data, can run in parallel with US7

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Household Onboarding)

```bash
# After Foundational (Phase 2) completes, launch US1 in parallel:

# Tests in parallel:
Task: "Contract test POST /households in apps/admin-dashboard/src/tests/api/households.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test POST /household_members in apps/admin-dashboard/src/tests/api/members.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test PATCH /households in apps/admin-dashboard/src/tests/api/households.test.ts"

# Components in parallel:
Task: "Create HouseholdForm component in apps/admin-dashboard/src/components/features/households/HouseholdForm.tsx"
Task: "Create MemberForm component in apps/admin-dashboard/src/components/features/households/MemberForm.tsx"
Task: "Create ResidenceSelector in apps/admin-dashboard/src/components/features/households/ResidenceSelector.tsx"
Task: "Create PhotoUpload in apps/admin-dashboard/src/components/features/households/PhotoUpload.tsx"

# Then sequential (depend on above):
Task: "Implement create household mutation"
Task: "Create HouseholdsPage"
Task: "E2E test household onboarding"
```

**Result**: 3 tests + 4 components built in parallel, then integrated sequentially ‚Üí US1 complete faster

---

## Parallel Example: Multiple User Stories with RLS Testing

```bash
# After Foundational (Phase 2) completes, assign to 4 developers:

Developer 1: Work on User Story 1 (Households) - Tasks T054-T072 + RLS tests
Developer 2: Work on User Story 2 (Stickers) - Tasks T073-T090 + RLS tests
Developer 3: Work on User Story 3 (Fees) - Tasks T091-T109 + RLS tests
Developer 4: Setup RLS policy tests in parallel - Tasks T038-T044

# All complete in parallel, then:
Developer 1: Work on User Story 4 (Permits) - Tasks T110-T126
Developer 2: Work on User Story 5 (Announcements) - Tasks T127-T141
Developer 3: Work on User Story 6 (Security Monitoring) - Tasks T142-T156
Developer 4: Work on User Story 7 (Analytics) - Tasks T157-T173

# Then all developers work on Polish (Phase 10)
```

**Result**: 7 user stories + RLS testing completed in ~4 sprint cycles vs 7+ sequential
