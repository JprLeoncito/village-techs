## Immediate Next Steps (MVP Priority)

### üéØ Step 1: Complete Phase 1 Setup
1. Install missing dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd apps/admin-dashboard
   npm install react-hook-form zod @hookform/resolvers
   npm install jspdf
   npm install -D vitest @vitest/ui
   npm install -D @playwright/test
   npm install -D @supabase/cli
   ```

2. Setup shadcn/ui component library:
   ```bash
   npx shadcn-ui@latest init
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add button input label select textarea
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add form table dialog
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add badge card tabs
   ```

### üéØ Step 2: Implement User Story 1 - Households (MVP Core)

**Priority**: P1 - Must Have
**Effort**: 3-4 days
**Tasks**: T054-T072 (19 tasks)

**Implementation Order**:
1. Create data fetching hooks (useHouseholds.ts, useHouseholdMembers.ts)
2. Build forms (HouseholdForm, MemberForm, PhotoUpload)
3. Implement pages (HouseholdsPage, HouseholdDetailPage)
4. Add validation and error handling
5. Test end-to-end

**Deliverable**: Admin can register new households with members and photos

### üéØ Step 3: Implement User Story 2 - Vehicle Stickers (MVP Core)

**Priority**: P1 - Must Have
**Effort**: 3-4 days
**Tasks**: T073-T090 (18 tasks)

**Implementation Order**:
1. Create sticker hooks (useStickers.ts)
2. Build sticker components (StickerQueue, StickerDetailModal, approval forms)
3. Integrate approve-sticker Edge Function
4. Implement bulk operations
5. Test approval workflow

**Deliverable**: Admin can approve/reject vehicle sticker requests

---

## Blockers & Risks

### üö´ Critical Blockers
1. **No shadcn/ui**: Need component library for forms, tables, modals
2. **No form validation**: Need react-hook-form + zod for robust forms
3. **No PDF library**: Need jsPDF for receipt generation (User Story 3)
4. **No testing setup**: Need Vitest and Playwright configured

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Risks
1. **No cron jobs**: Automated fee/sticker status updates not implemented
2. **No error boundary**: Need global error handling
3. **Missing UI components**: Need full shadcn/ui component set
4. **No audit logging integration**: Table exists but not used

### üìä Low Risks
1. **Performance untested**: No load testing for 500 households (SC-004)
2. **Analytics views unused**: Database views created but no frontend
3. **Real-time not implemented**: Gate monitoring needs Supabase Realtime

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (This Week)
1. ‚úÖ **Install missing dependencies** (shadcn/ui, react-hook-form, zod, jsPDF)
2. ‚úÖ **Implement User Story 1** (Households) for MVP functionality
3. ‚úÖ **Implement User Story 2** (Vehicle Stickers) to complete MVP

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
4. Implement User Story 3 (Association Fees) for financial tracking
5. Setup testing frameworks (Vitest, Playwright)
6. Write contract tests for critical endpoints

### Medium Term (Next Month)
7. Implement User Story 4 (Construction Permits)
8. Implement User Story 5 (Announcements)
9. Setup cron jobs for automated status updates
10. Implement audit logging across all features

### Long Term
11. Implement User Story 6 (Security Monitoring) - depends on Feature 004
12. Implement User Story 7 (Analytics & Reports)
13. Phase 10: Polish and production readiness
14. Comprehensive E2E test suite

## Conclusion

**Backend**: ‚úÖ Excellent foundation - 100% of database schema, RLS policies, and edge functions complete

**Frontend**: üî¥ Critical gap - Only infrastructure complete, zero business logic implemented

**Overall**: üü° 15% Complete - Strong backend, frontend needs immediate implementation

**To make fully functional**: Implement User Stories 1-2 (Households + Stickers) = MVP operational (~1 week)

**To meet all spec requirements**: Implement User Stories 1-7 + Tests + Polish (~7-8 weeks)
