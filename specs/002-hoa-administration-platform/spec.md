# Feature Specification: HOA Administration Platform

**Feature Branch**: `002-hoa-administration-platform`
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "HOA Administration Platform - Admin dashboard for managing households, members, vehicle stickers, construction permits, announcements, fees, and security monitoring"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Onboard New Households and Members (Priority: P1)

An HOA admin needs to register a new household when residents move into a property, capturing household details, designating the household head, and adding family members so the household can access community services and facilities.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability that enables all other HOA services. Without household registration, residents cannot request stickers, pay fees, or access any community features. This is the entry point for all resident interactions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a household for a residence, assigning a household head, adding members with photos and details, then verifying the household appears in the system and members can be linked to user accounts. Delivers immediate value by establishing the resident database.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an admin views available residences, **When** they select a vacant residence and create a household with move-in date and household head details, **Then** the household is created with active status and appears in the household list
2. **Given** a household exists, **When** the admin adds household members with name, relationship, date of birth, contact info, and photo, **Then** each member is registered and associated with the household
3. **Given** a household member is registered, **When** the admin marks them as resident vs. beneficial user, **Then** the member type is recorded and affects their access permissions
4. **Given** a household member exists, **When** the admin links them to an authenticated user account, **Then** the member can log in and access resident services
5. **Given** a household is active, **When** the admin sets a move-out date, **Then** the household status changes to moved_out and access to services is terminated

---

### User Story 2 - Manage Vehicle Sticker Lifecycle (Priority: P1)

An HOA admin reviews vehicle sticker requests from residents, verifies vehicle documentation, approves or rejects requests, and manages sticker expiration and renewal to control vehicle access to the community.

**Why this priority**: Vehicle access control is a primary security and convenience feature for gated communities. Sticker management directly impacts daily resident experience and gate operations, making it critical from day one.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing pending sticker requests, reviewing vehicle plates and OR/CR documents, approving requests with expiry dates, then verifying stickers appear as active and can be revoked if needed. Delivers immediate value by enabling vehicle access control.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** residents have submitted sticker requests, **When** the admin views the sticker queue, **Then** they see all requests grouped by status (requested, approved, active, expiring, expired, rejected, revoked)
2. **Given** a sticker request is pending, **When** the admin reviews vehicle plate number, OR/CR documents, and RFID code, **Then** they can approve with a 1-year default expiry or reject with a reason
3. **Given** multiple sticker requests are valid, **When** the admin uses bulk approve, **Then** all selected requests are approved simultaneously with default settings
4. **Given** a sticker is active, **When** the admin revokes it due to policy violation or vehicle sale, **Then** the sticker status changes to revoked and gate access is immediately blocked
5. **Given** stickers are approaching expiry, **When** the system reaches 30 days before expiration, **Then** renewal reminders are generated and sent to household members

---

### User Story 3 - Process Association Fee Payments (Priority: P1)

An HOA admin creates fee records for households, tracks payment status, records received payments, generates receipts, and sends reminders to ensure timely collection of association dues and maintain community finances.

**Why this priority**: Fee collection is the financial backbone of HOA operations. Without fee management, the community cannot sustain operations. This is a critical business function that must be available immediately.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating monthly fees for households, recording payments, generating receipts, viewing overdue dashboard, and sending payment reminders. Delivers immediate value by enabling revenue collection and financial tracking.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an admin needs to bill households, **When** they create fee records with type (monthly, quarterly, annual, special_assessment), amount, and due date, **Then** fees are assigned to all applicable households with unpaid status
2. **Given** fees exist, **When** a household makes payment, the admin records the payment with amount and date, **Then** fee status updates to paid (or partial if amount is less than total) and a receipt is generated
3. **Given** fees are past due date, **When** the system checks daily, **Then** unpaid fees automatically change to overdue status and appear on the overdue dashboard
4. **Given** fees are overdue, **When** the admin sends payment reminders, **Then** reminder notifications are delivered to household members with outstanding balance details
5. **Given** special circumstances exist, **When** the admin waives a fee, **Then** the fee status changes to waived and is excluded from overdue calculations

---

### User Story 4 - Review and Approve Construction Permits (Priority: P2)

An HOA admin reviews construction permit requests from homeowners, evaluates project details and contractor information, calculates road fees based on project scope, approves or rejects permits, and tracks construction progress to maintain community standards.

**Why this priority**: Construction oversight is essential for maintaining property values and community aesthetics, but can be implemented after core household and financial functions are operational. Most communities don't have daily construction activity.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing permit requests, reviewing project descriptions and contractor details, calculating road fees, approving permits, tracking payment and construction status, then generating permit reports. Delivers value by enabling controlled home improvements.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** homeowners have submitted permit requests, **When** the admin views the permit queue, **Then** they see all requests with project description, start/end dates, contractor info, and estimated worker count
2. **Given** a permit request is under review, **When** the admin calculates road fees based on project scope and duration, **Then** the fee amount is set and linked to the permit
3. **Given** a permit is evaluated, **When** the admin approves it, **Then** permit status changes to approved and the homeowner is notified with road fee payment instructions
4. **Given** a permit is approved and fees are paid, **When** construction begins, the admin marks it as in_progress, **Then** the permit status updates and appears on active construction tracking
5. **Given** construction is complete, **When** the admin marks the permit as completed, **Then** final inspection is recorded and permit is archived

---

### User Story 5 - Communicate via Announcements (Priority: P2)

An HOA admin creates and publishes announcements to inform residents about community events, maintenance schedules, fee reminders, or urgent matters, targeting specific audiences and tracking engagement to ensure effective communication.

**Why this priority**: Communication is important for community engagement but can be implemented after core operational functions. Announcements enhance the resident experience but aren't strictly required for basic HOA operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating announcements of different types, targeting specific audiences, scheduling publication, attaching documents, then viewing analytics on reads and engagement. Delivers value by enabling organized community communication.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an admin needs to communicate with residents, **When** they create an announcement with type (general, urgent, event, maintenance, fee_reminder, election), title, content, and target audience (all, households, security, admins), **Then** the announcement is saved as draft
2. **Given** an announcement is drafted, **When** the admin schedules it for immediate or future publication with optional expiry date, **Then** the announcement publishes at the scheduled time and appears to the target audience
3. **Given** an announcement needs supporting materials, **When** the admin attaches documents or images, **Then** files are uploaded and accessible to recipients when viewing the announcement
4. **Given** an announcement is published, **When** recipients view it, **Then** view count increments and click analytics are tracked for links
5. **Given** an announcement has reached its expiry date, **When** the system processes expiration, **Then** the announcement is archived and no longer visible to recipients

---

### User Story 6 - Monitor Security and Gate Activity (Priority: P2)

An HOA admin monitors real-time gate entry logs, tracks active security officers on duty, reviews incident reports, and generates usage analytics to maintain community security and identify access patterns.

**Why this priority**: Security monitoring provides valuable oversight but depends on gate infrastructure and security personnel being operational first. This is an enhancement to existing security operations rather than a foundational requirement.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing live gate entry logs, checking active security officer status, reading incident reports, and generating gate usage reports for date ranges. Delivers value by providing security visibility and accountability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** gates are operational, **When** the admin views the gate monitoring dashboard, **Then** they see real-time entry logs showing timestamp, gate location, vehicle/person, and entry type
2. **Given** security officers are on duty, **When** the admin checks active officer status, **Then** they see currently logged-in officers, their assigned gates, and shift duration
3. **Given** security incidents occur, **When** officers file incident reports, **Then** the admin can view report details including timestamp, location, incident type, and officer notes
4. **Given** the admin needs usage analytics, **When** they generate gate reports for a date range, **Then** reports show entry patterns, peak times, gate utilization, and incident summaries

---

### User Story 7 - Analyze Household and Community Metrics (Priority: P3)

An HOA admin generates reports and views analytics across household occupancy, sticker distribution, fee collection, gate usage, and construction activity to make data-driven decisions and identify operational trends.

**Why this priority**: Analytics provide strategic insights but are not required for day-to-day operations. Reports can be added after core transactional features are stable and generating meaningful data.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing occupancy statistics, sticker usage trends, payment collection reports, gate analytics, and construction logs, then exporting data for further analysis. Delivers value by enabling informed community management.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** household data exists, **When** the admin views occupancy statistics, **Then** they see total households, active vs. inactive counts, move-in/move-out trends, and vacancy rates
2. **Given** sticker data is available, **When** the admin views sticker analytics, **Then** they see active sticker count, expiring stickers, approval rates, and sticker distribution by household
3. **Given** fee collection is ongoing, **When** the admin generates payment reports, **Then** they see collection rates, overdue amounts, payment trends by period, and outstanding balances
4. **Given** gate activity is logged, **When** the admin views gate analytics, **Then** they see entry volume by gate, time-based patterns, and vehicle vs. pedestrian distribution
5. **Given** construction permits are tracked, **When** the admin views construction activity logs, **Then** they see active permits, completed projects, road fee collection, and permit approval timelines

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an admin tries to create a household for a residence that already has an active household?
- How does the system handle a household member who is linked to multiple households (e.g., caretaker)?
- What happens when a vehicle sticker expires while the vehicle is inside the community?
- How does the system prevent duplicate vehicle plate numbers across different households?
- What happens when a household moves out but has unpaid fees or active sticker requests?
- How does the system handle construction permits that extend beyond the estimated end date?
- What happens when an announcement is scheduled but the admin's permissions are revoked before publication?
- How does the system prevent fee double-payment when multiple admins record payments simultaneously?
- What happens when a security officer submits an incident report for a household that has moved out?
- How does the system handle RFID codes that are assigned to multiple vehicles (duplication)?
- What happens when an admin tries to revoke a sticker that is currently being used for gate entry?
- How does the system handle partial payment allocation across multiple fee types?
- What happens when a household head is removed but other members remain?
- How does the system handle announcements that target households but all recipients have moved out?
