# Feature Specification: Security Gate Operations Mobile Application

**Feature Branch**: `004-security-gate-operations`
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Security Gate Operations Mobile Application - Mobile app for security officers to manage gate entry/exit, verify residents/guests, process deliveries, verify construction workers, report incidents, and monitor security operations"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Process Resident and Vehicle Entry (Priority: P1)

A security officer at the gate scans RFID stickers or verifies vehicle plates, views household information, checks sticker validity, and logs entry/exit events to control access and maintain security records.

**Why this priority**: This is the core function of gate security operations. Every vehicle and pedestrian entry must be verified and logged. Without this capability, the gate cannot operate and community security is compromised. This is the fundamental requirement.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by scanning an RFID sticker, viewing household details and sticker status, logging entry with photos and entry type, then recording exit. Delivers immediate value by enabling basic gate operations and access control.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a vehicle approaches the gate, **When** the security officer scans the RFID sticker, **Then** the system displays household information, sticker status (active/expired), and sticker expiry date
2. **Given** an RFID scan is successful and sticker is active, **When** the officer logs entry with entry type (resident), vehicle plate, and optional photos (vehicle, driver), **Then** the entry event is recorded with timestamp, officer details, and gate location
3. **Given** a vehicle is leaving, **When** the officer logs exit for the same vehicle, **Then** the exit event is recorded and linked to the original entry
4. **Given** an RFID sticker is expired, **When** scanned, **Then** the system highlights expiry status and the officer can deny entry or allow with override reason
5. **Given** network is offline, **When** the officer scans RFID and logs entry, **Then** the event is queued locally and syncs when connection returns

---

### User Story 2 - Verify and Process Scheduled Guests (Priority: P1)

A security officer views the scheduled guest list, searches for expected visitors, verifies guest details against presented ID, marks guests as arrived, and notifies households when their guests enter the community.

**Why this priority**: Guest management is critical for daily operations as visitors are frequent. Without this capability, officers must rely on phone calls for every visitor, creating delays and poor user experience. This is essential for smooth gate operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing guest list, searching by name or household, verifying guest details and QR code/pass, marking as arrived, then recording departure. Delivers immediate value by streamlining visitor access.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** guests are scheduled for the day, **When** the officer views the guest list, **Then** they see all scheduled guests with household, expected arrival time, vehicle plate, and visit type (day-trip, multi-day)
2. **Given** a guest arrives at the gate, **When** the officer searches by guest name or household, **Then** matching guest records appear with full details for verification
3. **Given** guest details match presented ID, **When** the officer scans guest QR code or confirms manually and marks as arrived, **Then** the household receives arrival notification and entry is logged
4. **Given** an unexpected guest arrives (not on list), **When** the officer calls the household to confirm, **Then** they can log a walk-in visitor with household approval
5. **Given** a guest is departing, **When** the officer records guest departure, **Then** the visit is marked complete with exit timestamp

### User Story 3 - Log and Track Deliveries (Priority: P1)

A security officer logs package arrivals, captures delivery service details, takes photos of packages, marks perishable items, sends notifications to households, and tracks delivery handoff to ensure packages are accounted for.

**Why this priority**: Package delivery is a high-frequency daily activity that requires tracking for security and resident convenience. Lost or untracked deliveries cause resident complaints and security concerns, making this a critical operational need.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging delivery arrival with service name and tracking number, taking package photo, marking as perishable if needed, notifying household, then tracking handoff confirmation. Delivers immediate value by providing delivery visibility.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a delivery arrives at the gate, **When** the officer logs the delivery with service name (e.g., LBC, JRS, Lalamove), tracking number, and destination household, **Then** the delivery record is created
2. **Given** a delivery is being logged, **When** the officer takes a photo of the package, **Then** the photo is attached to the delivery record for reference
3. **Given** a delivery contains perishable items (food, medicine), **When** the officer marks it as perishable, **Then** the household receives priority notification
4. **Given** a delivery is logged, **When** the household is notified, **Then** they receive immediate push notification with delivery details and pickup instructions
5. **Given** a resident picks up their delivery, **When** the officer marks handoff complete with signature or confirmation, **Then** the delivery status updates to received

---

### User Story 4 - Verify Construction Workers and Permits (Priority: P2)

A security officer views active construction permits, verifies construction workers against approved permits, checks permit validity and dates, logs worker entry/exit, tracks headcount, and reports unauthorized construction activity.

**Why this priority**: Construction worker verification is important for security but less frequent than daily resident/guest/delivery operations. While essential for controlling contractor access, it can be implemented after core entry management is operational.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing active permits, verifying worker against permit details, checking permit dates and status, logging worker entry with headcount, tracking exit, and flagging unauthorized activity. Delivers value by controlling construction access.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** construction is ongoing in the community, **When** the officer views active construction permits, **Then** they see all valid permits with household, project description, contractor details, dates, and authorized worker count
2. **Given** a construction worker arrives, **When** the officer verifies their identity against the permit contractor information, **Then** they see permit validity (approved/expired, within date range) and can allow/deny entry
3. **Given** a worker is authorized, **When** the officer logs their entry and increments worker count, **Then** the entry is recorded and current headcount is tracked against permit limit
4. **Given** a worker is leaving, **When** the officer logs their exit and decrements worker count, **Then** the exit is recorded and headcount adjusts accordingly
5. **Given** unauthorized construction activity is detected (no permit, expired permit, excess workers), **When** the officer reports it as an incident, **Then** admin and household are notified for resolution

---

### User Story 5 - Report and Track Security Incidents (Priority: P2)

A security officer reports security incidents with type, severity, location, description, and supporting photos/videos, tracks incident status, views incident history, and receives incident assignments to maintain community safety.

**Why this priority**: Incident reporting is critical for safety but typically less frequent than routine gate operations. While essential for security management, the basic gate operations must be functional first. This enhances security oversight beyond basic access control.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating incident report with type (fire, medical, police, maintenance, disturbance, security breach), setting severity, adding location and details, uploading media, then tracking status and receiving assignments. Delivers value through comprehensive incident management.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a security incident occurs, **When** the officer creates an incident report with type (fire, medical, police, maintenance, disturbance, security_breach, other) and severity (low, medium, high, critical), **Then** the incident is recorded with timestamp and officer details
2. **Given** an incident is being reported, **When** the officer describes the location (gate, specific residence, common area), adds detailed notes, and uploads photos or videos, **Then** all information is attached to the incident
3. **Given** an incident is created, **When** it is submitted, **Then** relevant parties (security_head, admins, emergency services if critical) are immediately notified based on severity
4. **Given** incidents exist, **When** the officer views incident history, **Then** they see all past incidents with status (reported, investigating, resolved, closed) and can access full details
5. **Given** an incident is assigned to an officer, **When** they receive the assignment notification, **Then** they can view details and update status as they respond

---

### User Story 6 - Monitor Real-Time Gate Activity (Priority: P2)

A security officer views live gate entry feed, sees all recent entries across gates, monitors which officers are on duty, receives broadcast alerts, and tracks their shift hours to maintain situational awareness.

**Why this priority**: Real-time monitoring enhances oversight but is not required for basic gate operations. Officers can function without the live feed initially. This is valuable for security heads to supervise multiple gates but secondary to core entry processing.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing live entry feed with recent entries, seeing officer assignments at each gate, receiving broadcast alert, and tracking shift hours. Delivers value through enhanced visibility and coordination.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the officer is on duty, **When** they view the gate monitoring dashboard, **Then** they see live entry feed showing recent entries (last 50) with timestamp, entry type, vehicle/person, and gate location
2. **Given** the officer is a security_head, **When** they access multi-gate monitoring, **Then** they see activity across all community gates with officer assignments and entry counts
3. **Given** officers are assigned to gates, **When** viewing officer assignments, **Then** they see which officers are on duty, their assigned gates, and shift start times
4. **Given** an urgent situation requires all officers, **When** security_head sends a broadcast alert, **Then** all on-duty officers receive immediate push notification with alert details
5. **Given** an officer is on shift, **When** they check shift tracking, **Then** they see their clock-in time, elapsed shift hours, and can clock out when shift ends

---

### User Story 7 - Generate Security Reports (Priority: P3)

A security head generates shift reports, views gate entry statistics, exports entry logs for analysis, and tracks incident trends to analyze security operations and identify patterns.

**Why this priority**: Reporting and analytics provide strategic value but are not required for daily operations. Officers can perform gate duties without reports. This is an enhancement for security management and operational improvement, making it lower priority.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating shift report for a date range, viewing entry statistics by type and gate, exporting logs to file, and viewing incident trend analysis. Delivers value through operational insights and accountability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a security_head needs shift accountability, **When** they generate a shift report for a date range, **Then** they see entries/exits processed per officer, incident counts, shift hours, and gate coverage
2. **Given** gate activity data exists, **When** the security_head views entry statistics, **Then** they see breakdowns by entry type (resident, guest, delivery, construction), time patterns, and gate distribution
3. **Given** historical data is needed for analysis, **When** the security_head exports entry logs for a period, **Then** they receive a downloadable file with all entry/exit records and details
4. **Given** multiple incidents have occurred, **When** the security_head views incident trends, **Then** they see incident frequency by type, severity distribution, resolution times, and pattern analysis
