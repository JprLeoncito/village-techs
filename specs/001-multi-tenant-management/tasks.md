# Tasks: Multi-Tenant Management Platform (Platform Dashboard)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-multi-tenant-management/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md (user stories), research.md (tech decisions), data-model.md (schema), contracts/ (API)

## Path Conventions
- **Web app structure**: `apps/platform-dashboard/` (frontend), `supabase/` (backend)
- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + PostgREST + Edge Functions)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup (Phase 1) - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational (Phase 2) completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed) or sequentially by priority
  - Recommended sequential order for single developer: US1 (P1) ‚Üí US2 (P2) ‚Üí US3 (P2) ‚Üí US4 (P2) ‚Üí US5 (P3) ‚Üí US6 (P3)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ **START HERE FOR MVP**
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Requires community from US1 to exist (test data)
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Requires community from US1 to exist (test data)
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Requires community from US1 to exist (test data)
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - Operates on communities created in US1
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - Best with multiple communities from US1-US4 for realistic analytics

### Within Each User Story

- Models/schema before services (T009-T017 foundational)
- Services/hooks before UI components
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks T001-T008 can run in parallel (marked [P])

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- Database tables T010-T015 can run in parallel (different tables)
- Views and RPCs T016-T017 can run in parallel after tables
- Frontend foundational T018-T025 can all run in parallel

**Within User Stories**:
- All components marked [P] can run in parallel (different files)
- Example US1: T027, T028, T029, T032 (4 components) can all run in parallel

**Cross-Story Parallelization** (if team capacity):
- After Foundational completes, ALL user stories can start in parallel by different developers
- US1 + US2 + US3 + US4 simultaneously (4 developers)
- US5 + US6 can start in parallel after US1 completes (for test data)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Community Creation)

```bash
# After Foundational (Phase 2) completes, launch US1 components in parallel:

Task: "Create CommunityForm component in apps/platform-dashboard/src/components/features/communities/CommunityForm.tsx"
Task: "Create subscription plan selector in apps/platform-dashboard/src/components/features/communities/SubscriptionPlanSelector.tsx"
Task: "Create logo upload component in apps/platform-dashboard/src/components/features/communities/LogoUpload.tsx"
Task: "Create AdminUserForm component in apps/platform-dashboard/src/components/features/admin-users/AdminUserForm.tsx"

# Then sequential (depend on above):
Task: "Implement create community mutation in apps/platform-dashboard/src/hooks/useCommunities.ts"
Task: "Create CreateCommunityPage orchestrating workflow"
```

**Result**: 4 components built in parallel, then integrated sequentially ‚Üí US1 complete faster

---

## Parallel Example: Multiple User Stories

```bash
# After Foundational (Phase 2) completes, assign to 4 developers:

Developer 1: Work on User Story 1 (Community Creation) - Tasks T027-T038
Developer 2: Work on User Story 2 (Residences) - Tasks T039-T049
Developer 3: Work on User Story 3 (Gates + Map) - Tasks T050-T060
Developer 4: Work on User Story 4 (Admin Users) - Tasks T061-T071

# All complete in parallel, then:
Developer 1: Work on User Story 5 (Lifecycle) - Tasks T072-T082
Developer 2: Work on User Story 6 (Analytics) - Tasks T083-T094
Developers 3 & 4: Work on Polish (Phase 9) - Tasks T095-T110
```

**Result**: 6 user stories + polish completed in ~3 sprint cycles vs 6+ sequential
