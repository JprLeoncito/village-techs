# Feature Specification: Multi-Tenant Management Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-multi-tenant-management`
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a comprehensive specification for the Platform App (Superadmin Dashboard). FEATURE: Multi-Tenant Management Platform. USER ROLE: superadmin. CORE CAPABILITIES: 1. Tenant (Residential Community) Management, 2. Residence Setup, 3. Gate Configuration, 4. Admin User Management, 5. Platform Analytics"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create and Configure New Residential Community (Priority: P1)

A platform superadmin needs to onboard a new residential community by creating the tenant, configuring basic settings, and establishing the initial administrator account so the community can begin using the system.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability that enables all other functionality. Without the ability to create and configure tenants, no communities can use the platform.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new community with name, location, contact info, and admin credentials, then verifying the admin can log in and access their community dashboard. Delivers immediate value by allowing new communities to join the platform.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the superadmin is logged into the platform dashboard, **When** they create a new residential community with required information (name, location, contact details), **Then** the community is created with a unique identifier and appears in the tenant list
2. **Given** a new community has been created, **When** the superadmin configures regional settings (timezone, currency, language), **Then** these preferences are saved and applied to the community's environment
3. **Given** a new community exists, **When** the superadmin creates the initial admin_head user with email and temporary password, **Then** the admin receives credentials and can log into their community dashboard
4. **Given** a community is configured, **When** the superadmin uploads a community logo, **Then** the logo is stored and displayed in the community's interface

### User Story 2 - Set Up Community Residences (Priority: P2)

A superadmin configures the physical residences within a community so that the community's admin can later assign residents and manage access control.

**Why this priority**: Residences are the core organizational units within a community. This must be completed before residents can be assigned or access permissions granted, making it critical for community operation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by adding individual residences or bulk importing via CSV for a configured community, then verifying residences appear with correct types, numbering, and attributes. Delivers value by enabling communities to map their physical infrastructure.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a community exists, **When** the superadmin adds a single residence with type (single_family, townhouse, condo, apartment), unit number, max occupancy, lot area, and floor area, **Then** the residence is created and associated with the community
2. **Given** a community needs multiple residences added, **When** the superadmin uploads a properly formatted CSV file with residence data, **Then** all valid residences are created in bulk and invalid entries are reported with error details
3. **Given** residences are being added, **When** the superadmin defines a unit numbering scheme, **Then** new residences follow the defined pattern for consistent addressing

---

### User Story 3 - Configure Community Gates and Access Points (Priority: P2)

A superadmin sets up entrance gates with types, operating hours, and physical locations so that the community can manage access control and security monitoring.

**Why this priority**: Gates are essential for security and access management. While not strictly required for basic system operation, they are critical for the access control features that provide primary value to communities.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by adding gates to a community with different types and operating hours, then verifying gates appear on the system with correct attributes and location data. Delivers value by establishing the foundation for access control features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a community exists, **When** the superadmin adds a gate with name, type (vehicle, pedestrian, service, delivery), operating hours, and GPS coordinates, **Then** the gate is created and appears in the community's gate list
2. **Given** a gate is created, **When** the superadmin configures hardware integration settings for RFID readers and cameras, **Then** the gate is ready for physical device connection
3. **Given** multiple gates exist, **When** the superadmin views the gate map, **Then** all gates appear at their configured coordinates with type indicators

---

### User Story 4 - Manage Community Admin Users (Priority: P2)

A superadmin creates, modifies, and deactivates admin users for communities to ensure proper access control and account security across the platform.

**Why this priority**: Admin user management is essential for delegating community administration and maintaining security, but can be performed after initial community setup.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating admin_officer users for a community, resetting passwords, and deactivating accounts, then verifying access changes take effect. Delivers value by enabling communities to have multiple administrators with appropriate access levels.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a community exists with an admin_head, **When** the superadmin creates an additional admin_officer user with email and role, **Then** the officer receives credentials and can access community management functions
2. **Given** an admin user exists, **When** the superadmin resets their password, **Then** a temporary password is generated and sent to the admin's email
3. **Given** an admin user is active, **When** the superadmin deactivates their account, **Then** the user can no longer log in and their access is immediately revoked
4. **Given** an admin user is deactivated, **When** the superadmin reactivates them, **Then** the user regains access with their existing credentials

---

### User Story 5 - Suspend, Reactivate, or Remove Communities (Priority: P3)

A superadmin manages the lifecycle of communities by suspending service for non-payment or policy violations, reactivating after issues are resolved, or removing communities that are closing permanently.

**Why this priority**: Lifecycle management is important for business operations but not required for initial platform launch. Communities can operate without suspension/deletion capabilities.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by suspending an active community and verifying users cannot access it, then reactivating and confirming access restoration. Deletion can be tested by removing a test community and verifying data retention. Delivers value by providing business control over tenant status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a community is active, **When** the superadmin suspends the tenant, **Then** all community users lose access and see a suspension notice
2. **Given** a community is suspended, **When** the superadmin reactivates the tenant, **Then** all authorized users regain immediate access to their accounts and data
3. **Given** a community needs to be removed, **When** the superadmin performs a soft delete, **Then** the community is marked as deleted, users lose access, but data is retained for 30 days before permanent deletion

---

### User Story 6 - Monitor Platform Analytics (Priority: P3)

A superadmin views aggregated statistics and usage metrics across all communities to monitor platform health, identify trends, and generate reports for business decision-making.

**Why this priority**: Analytics provide valuable business intelligence but are not required for core platform operation. This is an enhancement that adds visibility after the platform has active tenants.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing the analytics dashboard with multiple active communities and verifying accurate display of tenant counts, usage statistics, subscription status, and generated reports. Delivers value by providing operational visibility and business insights.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple communities exist on the platform, **When** the superadmin views the analytics dashboard, **Then** they see total tenant count, active vs suspended communities, and overall system usage metrics
2. **Given** communities are active on the platform, **When** the superadmin views community status, **Then** they see breakdown by community status and creation dates
3. **Given** the superadmin needs historical data, **When** they generate a platform-wide report for a date range, **Then** the report includes tenant activity, user counts, and key performance indicators

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a CSV import contains duplicate residence unit numbers?
- What happens when a superadmin tries to delete a community that has active residents?
- How does the system handle timezone conversion for operating hours when a gate spans midnight?
- What happens when a superadmin tries to create an admin user with an email that already exists in the system?
- How does the system handle community logo uploads that exceed size limits or are in unsupported formats?
- What happens when a superadmin suspends a community while users are actively logged in?
- How are gate coordinates validated to ensure they fall within reasonable geographic bounds?
- What happens when bulk CSV import partially fails (some rows valid, some invalid)?
- How does the system prevent accidental deletion of communities with active data?
- What happens when a superadmin tries to reactivate a community that has been suspended for an extended period?

## Assumptions

- Email delivery infrastructure is available and reliable for sending admin credentials
- Superadmin users have appropriate training and understand multi-tenant platform concepts
- Communities provide accurate geographic coordinates for gates in decimal degrees format
- CSV import files follow a documented template format with consistent column headers
- Logo uploads are limited to common web formats (PNG, JPG, SVG) with maximum file size of 2MB
- Hardware integration for gates (RFID, cameras) uses standard protocols with configuration stored but not directly managed
- Platform operates in single-region deployment with communities in compatible timezones
- Soft delete retention period follows industry standard of 30 days unless specified otherwise
- Concurrent editing is rare enough that optimistic locking is acceptable
- Report generation is asynchronous for large date ranges to prevent timeout

## Dependencies

- Email service provider for delivering admin credentials
- Authentication system for superadmin and admin user login
- File storage service for community logos and CSV imports
- Mapping service for displaying gate locations (coordinates to map rendering)
- Audit logging infrastructure for compliance and troubleshooting

## Out of Scope

- Physical gate hardware installation and configuration (system stores settings only)
- Resident management and onboarding (performed by community admins, not superadmins)
- Mobile application for superadmin functions (desktop/tablet web only)
- Community-to-community data migration or merging
- Automated suspension based on external factors (manual superadmin action required)
- Custom report builder (fixed report templates only)
- Real-time chat or communication between superadmins and community admins
- Multi-language interface for superadmin dashboard (English only)
- Import/export of gate hardware configurations to device formats
