-- =========================================
-- TEMPORARY FIX: Allow household members to create guests
-- =========================================

-- Drop all existing policies on scheduled_guests to start fresh
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Household members can manage their scheduled guests" ON scheduled_guests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all scheduled guests" ON scheduled_guests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Security can view active guests" ON scheduled_guests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create guests with matching tenant" ON scheduled_guests;

-- Create a very simple policy for testing - allow any authenticated user
-- to insert guests if they can provide a valid tenant_id
CREATE POLICY "Allow inserts with valid tenant_id" ON scheduled_guests
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND
    tenant_id IS NOT NULL
  );

-- Allow users to manage their own household's guests
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own household guests" ON scheduled_guests
  FOR ALL
  USING (
    auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND
    household_id IN (
      SELECT household_id
      FROM household_members
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND status = 'active'
    )
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND
    household_id IN (
      SELECT household_id
      FROM household_members
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND status = 'active'
    )
  );

-- Fallback: Allow any authenticated user to read guests (for development)
CREATE POLICY "Allow reads for authenticated users" ON scheduled_guests
  FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);
