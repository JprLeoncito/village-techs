-- =========================================
-- TEMPORARY FIX: Simplify RLS policy for scheduled_guests
-- =========================================

-- Drop the existing complex policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Household members can manage their scheduled guests" ON scheduled_guests;

-- Create a simpler policy that checks household membership more directly
CREATE POLICY "Household members can manage their scheduled guests" ON scheduled_guests
  FOR ALL
  USING (
    tenant_id = (auth.jwt() ->> 'tenant_id')::UUID
    AND household_id IN (
      SELECT hm.household_id
      FROM household_members hm
      WHERE hm.user_id = auth.uid()
      AND hm.status = 'active'
    )
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    tenant_id = (auth.jwt() ->> 'tenant_id')::UUID
    AND household_id IN (
      SELECT hm.household_id
      FROM household_members hm
      WHERE hm.user_id = auth.uid()
      AND hm.status = 'active'
    )
  );

-- Alternative: Create a policy for testing that allows any authenticated user
-- to create guests for their household if they have the tenant_id
CREATE POLICY "Users can create guests with matching tenant" ON scheduled_guests
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    tenant_id = (auth.jwt() ->> 'tenant_id')::UUID
  );
